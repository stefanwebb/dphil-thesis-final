I would like to thank first and foremost my girlfriend, Anjuli, and my parents back in Australia. Without your love and support I could not have gotten through this arduous time. I would also like to extend a special thanks to Tom Rainforth, whose mentorship was instrumental in bringing our work to publication---you have taught me a lot. I am grateful to my supervisors, Pawan and Yee Whye, for their guidance and direction, and my colleagues and collaborators in Engineering Science and Statistics for providing a stimulating intellectual environment. Lastly, I am thankful to Steve Roberts and Niki Trigoni, and the financial support provided by the AIMS CDT program and the EPSRC, for providing the opportunity to study at Oxford and become a published researcher, all the while experiencing many wonderful things---music, theatre, debates, speeches, and meeting the love of my life.
