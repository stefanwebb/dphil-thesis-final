%%%%% CHOOSE YOUR LINE SPACING HERE
% This is the official option.  Use it for your submission copy and library copy:
%\setlength{\textbaselineskip}{22pt plus2pt}
\setlength{\textbaselineskip}{21pt plus2pt}
% This is closer spacing (about 1.5-spaced) that you might prefer for your personal copies:
%\setlength{\textbaselineskip}{18pt plus2pt minus1pt}

% You can set the spacing here for the roman-numbered pages (acknowledgements, table of contents, etc.)
\setlength{\frontmatterbaselineskip}{18pt plus1pt minus1pt}

% Leave this line alone; it gets things started for the real document.
\setlength{\baselineskip}{\textbaselineskip}

%\renewcommand{\contentsname}{\hfill Contents \hfill \hfillline}

%%%%% CHOOSE YOUR SECTION NUMBERING DEPTH HERE
% You have two choices.  First, how far down are sections numbered?  (Below that, they're named but
% don't get numbers.)  Second, what level of section appears in the table of contents?  These don't have
% to match: you can have numbered sections that don't show up in the ToC, or unnumbered sections that
% do.  Throughout, 0 = chapter; 1 = section; 2 = subsection; 3 = subsubsection, 4 = paragraph...

% The level that gets a number:
\setcounter{secnumdepth}{3}
% The level that shows up in the ToC:
\setcounter{tocdepth}{1}

% JEM: Pages are roman numbered from here, though page numbers are invisible until ToC.  This is in
% keeping with most typesetting conventions.

	%%%%% DEDICATION -- If you'd like one, un-comment the following.
	%\begin{dedication}
	%This thesis is dedicated to\\
	%someone\\
	%for some special reason\\
	%\end{dedication}
	
	
	%%%%% ABSTRACT -- Nothing to do here except comment out if you don't want it.
	\begin{abstract}
		\input{abstract}
	\end{abstract}
	
	%%%%% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS -- Nothing to do here except comment out if you don't want it.
	\begin{acknowledgements}
		\input{thanks}
	\end{acknowledgements}
	
	
	%%%%% MINI TABLES
	% This lays the groundwork for per-chapter, mini tables of contents.  Comment the following line
	% (and remove \minitoc from the chapter files) if you don't want this.  Un-comment either of the
	% next two lines if you want a per-chapter list of figures or tables.
	%\dominitoc % include a mini table of contents
	%\dominilof  % include a mini list of figures
	%\dominilot  % include a mini list of tables
	
	% This aligns the bottom of the text of each page.  It generally makes things look better.
	\flushbottom
	
	% This is where the whole-document ToC appears:
	\tableofcontents
	
	%\listoffigures
	%\mtcaddchapter
	% \mtcaddchapter is needed when adding a non-chapter (but chapter-like) entity to avoid confusing minitoc
	
	% Uncomment to generate a list of tables:
	%\listoftables
	%	\mtcaddchapter
	
	%%%%% LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS
	% This example includes a list of abbreviations.  Look at text/abbreviations.tex to see how that file is
	% formatted.  The template can handle any kind of list though, so this might be a good place for a
	% glossary, etc.
	%\include{misc/abbreviations}
	
	% The Roman pages, like the Roman Empire, must come to its inevitable close.
